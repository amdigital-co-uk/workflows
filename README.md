## Overview

This repository contains workflows used by the software team behind the [Quartex](https://www.quartexcollections.com/) platform, and form part of our CI/CD pipeline. This repository is public (as it is the only way Workflows can be be shared between repositories), although most of our other repositories are not.

This is an experimental replacement for [quartex-workflows](https://github.com/amdigital-co-uk/quartex-workflows), experimenting with a new way of managing and versioning workflows, along with using more consistent naming conventions for inputs etc.
